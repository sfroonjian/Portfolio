                                It is my pleasure to write this letter of recommendation for Sandra Froonjian. Sandra worked for me for almost four years as the public relations representative for my company, Kulture Kombucha LLC, and she consistently stood out as one of the most hard-working and dependable employees I have ever met.
                                <br><br>
                                As the public relations representative, Sandra would juggle several tasks on daily basis. One of her main roles was maintaining communication with current clients and dealing with any issues from clients as they arose.
                                Even when faced with the most difficult or even angry clients, Sandra never failed to impress me with her ability to remain calm, professional, and diplomatic while diffusing the situation and keeping the client happy.
                                <span id="dots1">...</span>
                                <span id="more1">
                                Her excellent customer service and communication skills were also frequently demonstrated when Sandra would seek out potential clients and run markets. Her positivity and energetic personality, along with her impressive knowledge of the product, always won people over and increased our sales and clients tremendously.
                                <br><br>
                                Throughout the time that Sandra worked for me, the company was constantly evolving, and so were Sandra’s job duties. She often demonstrated her ability to learn quickly and work with a diverse group of people by performing a wide range of duties outside of her job description including, but not limited to, creating a website for our company, generating product reports, digitally designing labels and brochures, and creating and operating our social media pages. No matter what job she was asked to complete, she always put in 110% effort and never missed a deadline. Her strong organizational skills were also evident in the spreadsheets she submitted.
                                <br><br>
                                In summary, Sandra’s positivity, diligence, dependability, and ability to work well with clients and co-workers made her a valuable asset to Kulture Kombucha, and I am confident she will make a valuable asset to any other job, including in the tech field. Rarely have I been able to recommend someone without reservation, but it is a pleasure for me to do so in the case of Sandra Froonjian.
                                <br><br>

                                I am writing this reference at the request of Sandra Froonjian. I have had the pleasure of working with Sandra for seven years while she served as an employee for the White Meadow Lake POA.
                                <br><br>
                                I first met Sandra when she was lifeguard. It did not take me long to realize that Sandra was a natural born leader. The following summer I promoted Sandra to head lifeguard, and then on to my assistant manager. Sandra is exceptionally responsible and volunteers to help out with and task, from the mundane to the challenging. I have rarely met an employee I can rely on as confidently as Sandra. She has never missed a day of work, and regularly volunteers to help out with any task, even if it is beyond her expected duties.

                                From the start, I realized that I could trust Sandra, primarily because of her work ethic and leadership skills. I can rely on Sandra to make sure the pools and beaches run smoothly, and manage the daily operations of the workplace in my absence. I can always count on Sandra to lend a helping hand.
                                <br><br>
                                As a teacher myself, I am confident that Sandra’s leadership role at White Meadow Lake will help her transition into her leadership role as a teacher. I think very highly of Sandra and recommend her without reservations to be an employee of your school district. Please don’t hesitate to contact me with any questions you may have. My phone number and email address are listed below.

                                I am writing regarding a candidate of excellent quality, Sandra Froonjian, who is applying for a position in your school district. I have had the pleasure of supervising Sandra over the past year as she completed a long-term leave position as a seventh-grade Science teacher at Markham Place School. While Sandra is a novice teacher, she has demonstrated the ability to build a culture of learning in her classroom along with content and pedagogical knowledge beyond her years of experience. Sandra’s positive outlook, tireless work ethic, creativity and “can-do” attitude allow me to highly recommend her. In her science classroom, Sandra provides individualized and rigorous instruction to her students. Sandra is among the best I have seen at using data to creatively design meaningful lessons that challenge her students to raise their individual level.
                                <span id="dots3">...</span>
                                <span id="more3">
                                Sandra is well versed in the principles of Differentiate Instruction, Universal Design for Learning, and Data Driven Instruction, all of which allow her to facilitate meaningful learning opportunities for her students. Employees who are in temporary positions sometimes shy away from becoming part of the team, but Sandra has done the opposite. Sandra works collegially with all members of the Markham Place staff and has become a valued member of the seventh-grade team. She asks good questions, is quick to implement and experiment with suggested strategies and is supportive of every member of the team.
                                <br><br>
                                Accomplishing these undertakings requires unflagging energy, a vast understanding of curricula and considerable people skills. Sandra possesses these in abundance. I am truly impressed with her ability to complete complicated tasks with consistent precision.
                                <br><br>
                                When enumerating Sandra’s strengths, I am reminded of the Thomas Edison quote, “There is no substitute for hard work.” Sandra will exhaust herself to ensure the best for everyone around her. You will find her to be a positive addition to your school culture. In view of this and the aforementioned, I recommended her without reservation.

                                It is my pleasure to recommend Ms. Sandra Froonjian for your position as a ​Teacher of Biological Science​. Ms. Froonjian has worked with me for one year as a leave-replacement teacher and I have been consistently impressed by her hard work, professional knowledge, and excellent judgement.
                                <br><br>
                                At Biotechnology High School, Ms. Froonjian taught four sections of ​Introduction to Biology & Genetics​. The course is a core requirement for all incoming 9th graders and is heavy on laboratory practice. Ms. Froonjian impressed me from the beginning with her ability to manage the prep, supplies, and classroom experience. During the times I observed her, she always organized engaging, multimodal lessons designed to inspire students to mastering the learning objectives.

                                Outside the classroom, Ms. Froonjian collaborated well with her subject area colleagues and the faculty as a whole. She had an excellent working relationship with her mentor teacher, and Ms. Froonjian would often be proactive in asking questions or addressing a student concern. She was also a member of our School Improvement Committee (ScIP). There, she would actively participate in meetings and share perspectives as a new teacher.
                                <br><br>
                                Over the past year, Ms. Froonjian has consistently demonstrated the dedication, knowledge, and judgement of a veteran teacher. She is a natural in the classroom and was an excellent addition to our program. I recommend her without reservations.

                                It is my pleasure to write this letter of recommendation for Sandra Froonjian. I have known Sandra (Sandy) since she started at Biotechnology High School (BTHS) in September 2018. I have served as Sandra’s mentor and have had the privilege to work with her in a number of learning communities as well.
                                <br><br>
                                Sandy’s previous middle school and high school teaching experience enabled her to quickly and smoothly transition to her new responsibilities at BTHS. Sandy invested a significant amount of time familiarizing herself with the biology curriculum, faculty responsibilities, and school procedures, yielding a well-prepared start to the year. She has continued to maintain this level of preparedness in her work.

                                <span id="more5">
                                Sandy has a strong attention to detail. This extends to curriculum alignment with all state standards and NGSS, the organization and preparedness of her labs, her ability to effectively communicate to students her expectations, classroom objectives, and homework requirements, and even to her desire to quickly know the name of every student.
                                <br><br>
                                As a relatively new teacher, Sandy regularly observes other teachers and engages in conversation exploring new teaching techniques and best practices. She receives constructive feedback very well and is genuinely concerned about improving all aspects of her instruction and classroom management. Sandy’s ability to recognize student dynamics and potential issues is very good. She seeks advice from other faculty about these issues, when necessary. Student issues are quickly addressed, and quickly resolved. Her control of the classroom has gained her the respect of the students.
                                <br><br>
                                Sandy has an energetic yet calming presence in and outside of the classroom. She is responsible, motivated, and creative. She readily involves herself in the school, volunteering frequently and supporting students in their extracurricular activities such as attending play performances, helping with fundraisers, and offering her time to chaperone events.
                                <br><br>
                                In summary, Sandy’s preparation, attention to detail, ability to challenge and encourage her students, and her desire to work collaboratively with faculty and administration make her an excellent colleague and teacher. I would recommend Sandra Froonjian without reservation.
                                <br><br>
